/**
 * Why this exists.
 *
 * PostHog derives `session_duration` from `max(timestamp) - min(timestamp)`
 * over a session's events, and `$pageleave` only fires on `pagehide` — never
 * on `visibilitychange`. A visitor who lands, reads, clicks nothing and leaves
 * the tab open therefore emits exactly one event, records a duration of zero,
 * and is classified as a bounce. Measured 2026-09-18: that is 13.6% of desktop
 * and 17.8% of mobile homepage sessions.
 *
 * This tracker exists to make the recorded duration reflect the real one. That
 * only holds if it counts *visible* time and nothing else — time in a hidden
 * background tab is not engagement, and counting it would inflate the metric
 * rather than correct it. The hidden-time tests below are the ones that keep
 * this honest, so treat them as load-bearing rather than incidental.
